        0) âœ” add new artificial true multivariate data. Extreme Example: One random series that is repeated in a another series, but timeshifted by n steps, This should not work in arima at all

        2) âœ• Stateful (will likely not happen)
        3) Test use of package with real data, e.g. air pollution
